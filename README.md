## Description

Since the introduction of Moodle 4.0, the UI for moodle is not as good as it used to be. There are

- Unnecessary card images which take up a lot of space
- Everything is **way too big**
- Inconsistent UI (especially with spacing)
- Sidebar which cannot be hidden

This theme aims to fix all of these issues and make moodle look better. It gives you many options to customize how you want moodle to look like. It also enables auto login!

## Features
